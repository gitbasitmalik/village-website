        <i>Being at a high altitude, this region hosts extreme winters (starting October) and a temperate and slightly
          humid summer (April onwards) which temperatures reaching 30C. July and August also see the monsoon which cause
          a pleasant drop in temperature.
          <br><br>
          Farming is the main occupation of the population. The farming is done by oxen in remote areas but in villages
          with better accessibility the land is ploughed by machinery. The two crops grown there are rabi and kharaif.
          The major rabi crops grown in the area are <b>potato and maize</b>, and the kharaif crop is only <b>wheat</b>,
          in a very
          small area of village. The wheat is used for cattle and for grain only. Some vegetables are also found here,
          including turnip, radish, pea's, pumpkin, bean's and mustard.
          <br><br>
          <b>Fruits like pear, apple, black grapes, grapes, fig, peach, damson plum, mulberry, wild fig, lemon, apricot,
            charry are found in abundance in Namli Maira.</b> As the hill people lack awareness of the markets, they are
          unable to get a proper return. These fruits are therefore used for subsistence. Most of the area around these
          mountain villages is covered with trees. Peaks are covered with evergreen trees including pine, walnut, oak
          and maple trees. Herbs, shrubs, wild flowers and thorny bushes can be seen in abundance. Goats and other pet
          animals graze the pastures.</i>

        <b>The main occupation of the people is subsistence farming and cattle breeding</b>. Farmers cultivate one crop
        per
        season as climatic conditions do not permit double cropping. The other occupation is are kept to supply milk for
        daily use of the household. Bullocks are used to work the plough.
        Poverty has forced many people to seek economic opportunities in the plains. Besides earning livelihood doing
        jobs in nearby towns, many have joined the army and civil service. Hotels in the nearby hill towns of Nathia
        Gali, Ayubia and Murree provide another source of employment to the locals. After turmoil in Swat, Namli Maira
        is gradually becoming popular with tourists from down country.
        <br>
        <b> Wood is the primary source of fuel and home construction, as there is no gas in Namli Maira</b>. People go
        to
        forests and cut trees so that they can light fires for cooking and other activities. Those who can afford them
        use LPG gas cylinders.
